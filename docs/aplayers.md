The foundation of scaling up a great company revolves around the People Decision – having the “right people on the bus" in author Jim Collins’ terminology. We use the Topgrading methodology that focuses on hiring, coaching and keeping A-players. 

What is an A player? - “A talented person who can do the job that needs to be done, while fitting in with the culture of the company.”

### Recruitment
People makes GoodUp what it is. Attracting and keeping the right people in the right positions is therefore of great importance. GoodUp uses the Top-grading method to search for A-players. A-players have the right skill set for the defined role and are high performers. Most importantly, they are also internally driven by GoodUp’s mission.

### Recruitment process
A vacancy need is submitted per team by the team manager towards the Management Team. After approval the recruiter will receive the content for the requested role and score
card where the expected output is described. 

Definition  of A-player during recruitment: “A Candidate who has at least a 90% chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10% of possible candidates could achieve.”

Throughout the process it is of high importance to involve the team in this process and 2 team members conduct the deep dive interview. At the end of the process three references will always be checked before hiring a new GoodUp team member.
