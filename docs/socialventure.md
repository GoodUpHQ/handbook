### üìò Social code
GoodUp was founded in 2016 by Bart Lacroix and Anna Chojnacka as a social Venture. They both were also the founders of 1%Club (2007) that is still one of the platforms running on GoodUp software.

GoodUp is a member of [Social Enterprise NL](www.social-enterprise.nl "Social Enterprise") that uses the following (European) definition for a social enterprise:

- Primarily has a social mission: impact first!
- Realises that as an independent company that provides a service or product;
- Is financially self-sufficient, based on trade or other forms of value exchange, and therefore limited or not dependent on donations or subsidies;
- social in the way the company is run: Profit is allowed, but the financial goals are at the service of the mission: increasing the social impact.
- Profit-taking by potential shareholders is reasonable.
- Governance and policy are based on a balanced say of all involved
- Fair to everyone
- Aware of its ecological footprint
- Is transparent

GoodUp follows where possible the following guidelines:
- Dutch Code Social Ventures - [https://www.codesocialeondernemingen.nl](https://www.codesocialeondernemingen.nl/english "Dutch code social ventures")
- BCorp - https://bcorporation.net

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Sustainability 
GoodUp consciously deals with sustainability. An example of this is that we enjoy daily vegetarian lunches. The development team has switched from large stacks of paper post-it‚Äôs to endless reusable magnets. In addition, we have replaced the lamps in our rooms with LED lamps, we print (as we print) double-sided and on recycled paper and we separate our paper and glass. Everyone who works at GoodUp comes to the office in Amsterdam by bike or public transport. Our office interior is mainly secondhand, because we think there are already enough stuff in the world.
