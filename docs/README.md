## Social Ventrure

### Social code
GoodUp was founded in 2016 by Bart Lacroix and Anna Chojnacka as a social Venture. They both were also the founders of 1%Club (2007) that is still one of the platforms running on GoodUp software.

GoodUp is a member of Social Enterprise NL (www.social-enterprise.nl) that uses the following (European) definition for a social enterprise:

•	Primarily has a social mission: impact first!
•	Realises that as an independent company that provides a service or product;
•	Is financially self-sufficient, based on trade or other forms of value exchange, and therefore limited or not dependent on donations or subsidies;
•	Is social in the way the company is run:
o Profit is allowed, but the financial goals are at the service of the mission: increasing the social impact.
o Profit-taking by potential shareholders is reasonable.
o Governance and policy are based on a balanced say of all involved
o Fair to everyone
o Aware of its ecological footprint
o Is transparent

GoodUp follows where possible the following guidelines:
•	Dutch Code Social Ventures (https://www.codesocialeondernemingen.nl/english)
•	BCorp (https://bcorporation.net

### Social code
GoodUp consciously deals with sustainability. This translates into using as many organic, fair-trade, and recycled products as possible. An example of this is that the daily vegetarian lunches are ordered via the organic grocery service and that additional groceries are purchased as much fairtrade and organic as possible. If catering is necessary, we select our choice for organic and fair trade assortment. Our delicious coffee comes from the fair chain coffee geeks from Moyee Coffee (www.moyeecoffee.com).

The development team has switched from large stacks of paper post-it’s to endless reusable magnets. In addition, we have replaced the lamps in our rooms with LED lamps, we print (as we print) double-sided and on recycled paper and we separate our paper and glass. Everyone who works at GoodUp comes to the office in Amsterdam by bike or public transport. Our office interior also comes as much as possible from gevondenopmarktplaats.nl. Because we think there are already enough stuff in the world, we do not have to buy everything new. The purest form of reuse, a sustainable initiative!

## Rockefeller Habits

### Habits
We follow the Rockefeller Habits methodology for ScaleUps.

These are the 10 Rockefeller Habits:
1.	The executive team is healthy and aligned
2.	Everyone is aligned with the #1 thing that needs to be accomplished this quarter to move the company forward
3.	Communication rhythm is established and information moves through the organization quickly
4.	Every facet of the organization has a person assigned with accountability for ensuring goals are met
5.	Ongoing employee input is collected to identify obstacles and opportunities
6.	Reporting and analysis of customer feedback data is as frequent and accurate as financial data
7.	Core values and purpose are “alive” in the organization
8.	Employees can articulate the key components of the company’s strategy accurately
9.	All employees can answer quantitatively whether they had a good day or week
10.	The company's plans and performance are visible to everyone 

### Meeting rhythm
Because discipline and routine matters for fast growing companies we follow a strict meeting rhythm in GoodUp. 

<strong>DAILY HUDDLE</strong>
On a daily basis, each team has a short stand-up of 5-15 minutes depending on the team
size. What’s your focus? What are your bottlenecks? Update of daily indicators. This way you are aligned with your team, get connected on your goal for the day, small disasters can be prevented and you can take advantage of unforeseen opportunities.

<strong>MMM (MONDAY MORNING MEETING)</strong>
On a weekly basis we sit together with the whole team around our picnic table. We discuss
celebrations, disappointments, show & shine, rocks, team updates, and any
other business. With the team updates, each team  gives a presentation about what their team has been working on.

<strong>FRIDAY DRINKS</strong>
Just as important as starting the week together is closing the week as one team. Every Friday we have a Friday afternoon drink start at 5 PM. Make sure at least for one drink so we can close the week together and share our disappointments and celebrate our successes of the week.

<strong>WEEKLY</strong>
The weekly meeting is a tactical meeting and is between 30 – 60 minutes. The agenda for
this meeting is:
•	Good News - Everyone shares two good news stories from the past week, one personal one business.
•	The Numbers – Everyone’s individual or team weekly measures of productivity will be reviewed. Only the outcome (preferably graphic) is reported.
•	Customer and Employee Data - What or where are the recurring issues or concerns that the team or its customers are facing day in and day out. One issue is chosen and a person or small group will be assigned to explore and get to the root cause of it.
•	Accountabilities and Commitments - Accountabilities from last meetings and from quarterly planning will be reviewed and updated. Where necessary rescheduled and commitments are made to complete accountabilities for next meeting.
•	Collective Intelligence - The focus is one challenge. This challenge is presented and lead by the person who’s accountable. Everyone’s input will be collected and drilled into one of the big issues.
•	One Phrase Closes - Everyone delivers a word or phrase about how they feel about the meeting.

<strong>MONTHLY</strong>
A half-day or full-day where you come together with your team to look at the progress of the current OKRs and collaboratively address one or two big issues that you need to fix.

<strong>QUARTERLY MEETING</strong>
At the end of each quarter, we plan a one day “Q Meeting” with the whole team. Taking this time together allows us to focus on our long-term strategy and translate it into smaller chunks that can be processed easier in daily activities. During the Q meet-up the theme team announces the GoodUp's new quarterly theme. 

The topics during a Q-Meeting are:
1)	Review your results from the previous quarter
2)	Check in on your company’s cultural health and team performance
3)	Participate to keep each other sharp and new ideas flowing to grow GoodUp
4)	Plan your next successful quarter.

Quarterly theme -  In order to get the whole team aligned, one priority is chosen to move the organisation forward. Each quarter the management team decides which priority is the most important that the whole team is working on.

## A-players

The foundation of scaling up a great company revolves around the People Decision – having the “right people on the bus" in author Jim Collins’ terminology. We use the Topgrading methodology that focuses on hiring, coaching and keeping A-players. 

What is an A player? - “A talented person who can do the job that needs to be done, while fitting in with the culture of the company.”

[image]

### Recruitment
People makes GoodUp what it is. Attracting and keeping the right people in the right positions is therefore of great importance. GoodUp uses the Top-grading method to search for A-players. A-players have the right skill set for the defined role and are high performers. Most importantly, they are also internally driven by GoodUp’s mission.

### Recruitment process
A vacancy need is submitted per team by the team manager towards the Management Team. After approval the recruiter will receive the content for the requested role and score
card where the expected output is described. 

Definition  of A-player during recruitment: “A Candidate who has at least a 90% chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10% of possible candidates could achieve.”

[image]

Throughout the process it is of high importance to involve the team in this process and 2 team members conduct the deep dive interview. At the end of the process three references will always be checked before hiring a new GoodUp team member.

## Onboarding

Welcome to the GoodUp team! We are very excited to welcome a new GoodUp colleague. 
To make sure you feel part of the team and to get you up and running as soon as possible we have created an onboarding programme. The complete onboarding program will be explained to you on your first day by the office manager.

The onboarding program will consists of:
• General introduction by CEO - Vision, Mission, BHAG, Core values, Rockefeller habits
• Introduction by Sales, Customer Success, Product and Branding
• Coffee with a college of each department

In order to assure that all needed hardware such as laptops, software
tools and office keys are ready, the office manager uses the on-boarding checklist. For each used GoodUp’s property such as a laptop or mobile phone the GoodUp team member needs to sign a separate user agreement.

New GoodUp team members will receive access to our People software tool, BambooHR.
You will receive an e-mail in which you can set up your login details and we will grants you access to your personal, job information and the employee directory. 

Before you start you will be asked to
• To introduce yourself to the team via a questionnaire in BambooHR
• Send a picture so we can put you on our website and prepare your email signature

### Your buddy
A new job can be overwhelming. To make sure you don’t feel lost a buddy will be assigned to you who will guide you through the first days, weeks and months.

Having a “buddy” at work can make a huge difference to the speed to manage to settle into your new role, your team and GoodUp’s culture. Just knowing there is someone here to listen who is genuinely interested in helping you should make you feel supported. 

The role of a buddy is different to that of a mentor, manager, or coach. This relationship is far less formal, with its core purpose being encouragement and friendship. Buddy duties include more than offering directions to the toilet and our printer. Your buddy will share useful, socially-focused information to help you with the cultural acclimation.

### Personal Performance & Development
As an inspiration on how to be an engaged high performer at GoodUp we follow the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey:

1.	Be Proactive, Not Reactive
2.	Begin With the End in Mind
3.	Put First Things First
4.	Think Win/Win
5.	Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
6.	Synergy
7.	Sharpen the Saw

At GoodUp we use the following framework to create an high performing culture and team:

[image]

We have quarterly goals and regular check-in’s. In the regular check ins the following questions will be discussed:
•	What did you do well and what went well?
•	What could you improve on?
•	What do you want to achieve (also in terms of personal development)?
•	Which steps do you need to take in order to reach your target(s)?
•	How are you planning to reach this?
•	What do you need from us to achieve this, what are your conditions?

[image]

### Perform
<strong>1:1 Check Ins</strong> - Objectives are set at a Company Level, Team level and Personal Level. They are set per year and per quarter and followed up per week. You will have regular 1:1 check ins with your Team Manager to follow up on the OKRs and Rocks.

<strong>OKRSs</strong> - OKR (Objectives & Key Results) is a goal management framework invented by Intel and later popularized by Google. An Objective defines your goal. It should set a clear direction to a point in the future. Key Results are metrics with a target and are indicators that show you how you're progressing towards your Objective. 

<strong>Rocks</strong> - Rocks are obstacles that you take away or new projects that you start. While objectives and key results are about your daily operational business working in your company are Rocks about working on your company. Rocks have innovation and change objectives to achieves your objectives better in the future. On average you should spend 80% of your time on your objectives and 20% on your Rocks.

### Engage
<strong>Praise & Show & Shine</strong> - When employees and their work are valued, their satisfaction and productivity rises, and they are motivated to maintain or improve their good work. Praise and recognition are essential to an outstanding workplace. People want to be respected and valued by others for their contribution. Small Improvements gives you the opportunity to Praise a colleague when they have done something outstanding. This will also show up in Slack and on their Profile. During the MMM you can also give a colleague a Show & Shine if they have achieved something special or for example showed behavior that really fit one of the Company Values.

<strong>Company Values</strong> – It’s important to reinforce the Company Values on a regular basis. To keep them alive we show them in the office, in presentations and on the website. We also share & celebrate value stories during the MMM, WEEKLY, MONTHLY and Q-Meeting. 

<strong>Pulse Surveys</strong> - To continues improve ourselves becoming a People First Culture it is very important to receive continues feedback and data. Therefor we send our regular Pulse Survey via Slack using Office Vibe. The Management Team will look at this input on a regular basis to come up with measurement for improvement.

### Develop
<strong>Purpose</strong> – People may become disengaged and demotivated at work if they don't understand, or can't invest in, the "bigger picture." But those who believe that they are working toward something larger and more important than themselves are often the most hard-working, productive and engaged. So, encouraging you to find purpose in your work is very important for us. 


<strong>Personal Development Objective</strong>s - Together with your team manager you set and monitor your Personal Development Objectives in Small Improvements.

For Covey (The  7 Habits of Highly Effective People), Sharpening the Saw is about taking the time to renew and refresh the four dimensions of our natures — physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional — so that we’re more effective in our life’s work. It’s about regularly investing in ourselves so that we can reap dividends on a continual basis. It means working smarter, not harder. One of GoodUp’s core values is ‘we are ambitious’ and we strongly believe if everyone regularly sharpens the saw, the GoodUp team member will not only grow as a person, grow within your role but will also allow GoodUp to grow. 

High performance people are generally self-improving through experience, observation, introspection, reading and discussion. Just like at Netflix we say: “We develop people by giving them the opportunity to develop themselves, by surrounding them with stunning colleagues and giving them big challenges to work on.” 

<strong>360 Feedback</strong> - Throughout the year we strive to regularly give and receive thoughtful and honest feedback. This can either be done in person or through 360 degrees feedback. As a tool we use small improvements.com and helps us to make this process easy and fun.

Everyone working at GoodUp, has a yearly budget of € 250 to spend on work relevant
training. For this purpose, you have to discuss this with your team manager. This time spent on personal development can be done during working hours. This budget is personal and cannot be transferred to anyone else. There is also the opportunity to take unpaid leave time in order to follow a class or a course outside your training & development budget; this as well needs approval of your team manager.

You’re eligible to 2 working days of paid and 3 working days of unpaid paternity leave. This is applicable for both part-time and fulltime employment. After having notified the People manager of the actual birth date, you can consecutively take these 5 days off as of the first workday.

Parental leave (ouderschapsverlof)
In order to facilitate work-life balance, GoodUp provides parental leave. To be eligible for
parental leave, you have to have worked for GoodUp for at least one year. Parental leave is
applicable for both parents and equals 1040 hours per child till your child/children reach the
age of 8. You have to request parental leave at least two months before the start in writing to the People manager. Parental leave is unpaid which also means that during that time no vacation days are built up.

Adoption and Foster care leave (adoptie en pleegzorgverlof)
When you adopt or take a foster child in your family, you are entitled to leave so you and
your child(ren) can get used to each other. The condition for adoption leave is that the court
has pronounced the adoption and for foster care leave that the child is registered at the
address of the foster parent. The leave takes up to 4 weeks.

Unpaid leave (onbetaald verlof)
GoodUp might grant unpaid leave under particular circumstances or upon request. Unpaid leave has to be requested in writing at least 3 months before the first day of leave. GoodUp can refuse the request for unpaid leave. During unpaid leave, no salary is paid, nor vacation.

### Sick leave
When you fall ill, you have to inform your Team manager and the office manager as soon as
possible but latest by 9.30 am of the same day by Slack and BambooHR
time off request tool. In case you are still sick and unable to work after two days, on the third day of sickness the office manager might request a doctor’s certificate. The certificate has to confirm the inability to work and the expected time frame.

If you are not able to perform your duties due to sickness, GoodUp will continue to pay the
salary for a period of 2 years (104 weeks), if and as long as the employment contract
continues, providing that GoodUp will pay the salary specified in your employment contract
for the first year (52 weeks) of the occupational disability. When the period of occupational
disability lasts longer than a year (52 weeks), GoodUp will pay 70% of the aforementioned
salary for the second period of 52 weeks. If the sickness lasts longer than 2 years and the
employment contract still exists, GoodUp will neither pay a salary, nor a supplement to the
WIA or any other benefits after those 2 years. There are no waiting days in case of sickness.
