### Habits
We follow the Rockefeller Habits methodology for ScaleUps.

These are the 10 Rockefeller Habits:
1.	The executive team is healthy and aligned
2.	Everyone is aligned with the #1 thing that needs to be accomplished this quarter to move the company forward
3.	Communication rhythm is established and information moves through the organization quickly
4.	Every facet of the organization has a person assigned with accountability for ensuring goals are met
5.	Ongoing employee input is collected to identify obstacles and opportunities
6.	Reporting and analysis of customer feedback data is as frequent and accurate as financial data
7.	Core values and purpose are “alive” in the organization
8.	Employees can articulate the key components of the company’s strategy accurately
9.	All employees can answer quantitatively whether they had a good day or week
10.	The company's plans and performance are visible to everyone 

### Meeting rhythm
Because discipline and routine matters for fast growing companies we follow a strict meeting rhythm in GoodUp. 

<strong>DAILY HUDDLE</strong>
On a daily basis, each team has a short stand-up of 5-15 minutes depending on the team
size. What’s your focus? What are your bottlenecks? Update of daily indicators. This way you are aligned with your team, get connected on your goal for the day, small disasters can be prevented and you can take advantage of unforeseen opportunities.

<strong>MMM (MONDAY MORNING MEETING)</strong>
On a weekly basis we sit together with the whole team around our picnic table. We discuss
celebrations, disappointments, show & shine, rocks, team updates, and any
other business. With the team updates, each team  gives a presentation about what their team has been working on.

<strong>FRIDAY DRINKS</strong>
Just as important as starting the week together is closing the week as one team. Every Friday we have a Friday afternoon drink start at 5 PM. Make sure at least for one drink so we can close the week together and share our disappointments and celebrate our successes of the week.

<strong>WEEKLY</strong>
The weekly meeting is a tactical meeting and is between 30 – 60 minutes. The agenda for
this meeting is:
•	Good News - Everyone shares two good news stories from the past week, one personal one business.
•	The Numbers – Everyone’s individual or team weekly measures of productivity will be reviewed. Only the outcome (preferably graphic) is reported.
•	Customer and Employee Data - What or where are the recurring issues or concerns that the team or its customers are facing day in and day out. One issue is chosen and a person or small group will be assigned to explore and get to the root cause of it.
•	Accountabilities and Commitments - Accountabilities from last meetings and from quarterly planning will be reviewed and updated. Where necessary rescheduled and commitments are made to complete accountabilities for next meeting.
•	Collective Intelligence - The focus is one challenge. This challenge is presented and lead by the person who’s accountable. Everyone’s input will be collected and drilled into one of the big issues.
•	One Phrase Closes - Everyone delivers a word or phrase about how they feel about the meeting.

<strong>MONTHLY</strong>
A half-day or full-day where you come together with your team to look at the progress of the current OKRs and collaboratively address one or two big issues that you need to fix.

<strong>QUARTERLY MEETING</strong>
At the end of each quarter, we plan a one day “Q Meeting” with the whole team. Taking this time together allows us to focus on our long-term strategy and translate it into smaller chunks that can be processed easier in daily activities. During the Q meet-up the theme team announces the GoodUp's new quarterly theme. 

The topics during a Q-Meeting are:
1)	Review your results from the previous quarter
2)	Check in on your company’s cultural health and team performance
3)	Participate to keep each other sharp and new ideas flowing to grow GoodUp
4)	Plan your next successful quarter.

Quarterly theme -  In order to get the whole team aligned, one priority is chosen to move the organisation forward. Each quarter the management team decides which priority is the most important that the whole team is working on.
