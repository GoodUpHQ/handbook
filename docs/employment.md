<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Employment</h1>

### ⏲️ Working hours
A fulltime working week at GoodUp is 40 hours divided over 8 hours per day from Monday to Friday. The regular office hours are from Monday to Friday between 08.00 to 18.30 hours
with a half an hour lunch break. So when you start at 09:00 your workday ends at 17:30.

Different arrangements can be made based on mutual agreement. During some
events/deadlines GoodUp might ask you for your flexibility and expansion in working hours.
With part-time employment, your regular days off are captured in your employment contract.

Should it be needed to move your day off due to personal or work related reasons, you can
reschedule your regular day off within 2 weeks in advance. When your regular day off is on a public holiday, rescheduling your day is not possible.

### ⏳ Overtime and compensation
Overtime will not be compensated unless discussed otherwise. If overtime occurs outside office hours due to traveling abroad or to clients, for example giving a master class in the
evening. These hours can be compensated within 2 weeks in agreement with your team manager and the office manager should also be informed (by e-mail).

### 🏠 Working remote
We like to work together as a team and use our GoodUp office as a default, however it can
happen that it’s better to work remotely due to personal or work related reasons. When you want to work remotely you can request it through our Bamboo tool. Put it in your calendar so everybody knows where you are. When working remotely, you’re expected to be available on Slack and able to respond within half an hour.

### 🙃 Change in personal circumstances
For all changes of a personal nature that are related to the work relation (for example family
composition, relocation, marriage, working hours, etc.) the office manager need to be
informed – preferably through BambooHR if possible, otherwise e-mail - so action can be
taken where necessary.

### ⛔ End of employment
After informing your team manager, end of employment at GoodUp has to be submitted in
writing to the office manager. 

In the last working week:
- All-important data that are related to GoodUp need to be handed over to the team
manager.
-	An exit interview will be scheduled with your team manager so feedback can be
shared.
-	Upon request GoodUp could prepare a reference letter for you (if in good standing
with GoodUp).

At the end of employment, you’ll have to return all property to GoodUp that you received
while working at GoodUp, for instance laptop, mobile devices and the office keys.

Furthermore, on the last working day the office manager will shut down the access to all
software accounts such as e-mail, Dropbox and other GoodUp tools. Passwords will be reset
as well. In order to assure that all properties are returned and all access is shut down, the
office manager uses the off-boarding checklist.
