### üèùÔ∏è Holidays
GoodUp grants you 25 paid holidays per calendar year based on full-time employment; this
amount is pro-rated to the day you start or end your employment. The same applies to part-time employment. GoodUp has the right to refuse an application if the leave constitutes a major obstacle for the business. As a responsible employer, we want to do our very best to make sure that you have the opportunity to enjoy all of your holidays during a given year.
Transfer of holidays to the following year should be the exception and only happen in direct
consultation with your team manager.

All team members are aware of the peaks during the big campaigns/deadlines so if these
activities or the overall organisation will be jeopardized because of your holiday, your team
manager may not approve the holiday.

During the year, you should take at least once 2 weeks consecutively holiday. If you would
like to take more than three weeks, this can only be approved after permission from the
managing director in writing.

Cumulating days - It can happen that you do not use all of your leave during the year. Only a maximum of 5 days can be taken to next year and this needs to be discussed with the office manager beforehand.

Requesting extra days - Per calendar year you can purchase up to 5 working days. This can be requested through email to your team manager with a cc to the office manager. When approved, your days will be added to your holiday balance.
